# 🚀 Homework 1 - Your Amazing TodoList App

Welcome to your first assignment! This week, we'll be building a fun and useful **TodoList app**. Not only will you be honing your skills in JavaScript, but you'll also create a cool app that you can use every day!

## 🎯 What You'll Be Building 🏗️

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a simple TodoList app. Your app doesn't have to look exactly like our example, so let your creative juices flow! 💫

Your app should have these core features:

1. **Adding Todo Items**: Users should be able to add new tasks to their list.
2. **Removing Todo Items**: Users should be able to remove tasks when they are no longer necessary.
3. **Checking Off Todos**: Users should be able to mark tasks as completed. Nothing feels better than checking off a task!

For an extra challenge, try using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to keep your TodoList persistent. This way, your users won't lose their tasks, even if they refresh the page! 🚀
